# 2-Responsive-Portfolio

Homework #2

At this homework I used Bootstrap to create my portfolio site.
I have used following items:
navbar
responsive layout
responsive images
sticky footer

I have also added an extra  button at navbar, when you click on "Vladyslava Antonchenko" it  will return you to the home page.

p.s. I didn't add any projects for now but I'm working on it, and paragraph "About Me" will be completed as well.
